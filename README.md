## 🔍 What is this?

This script was designed to detect **Susano**, one of the most widespread FiveM cheats.  
It provided **instant detection**, based on low-level behavioral and memory patterns.

Even though this method is now outdated and patched, it serves as a demonstration of the past logic used.

## ❗ Why is this public?

This version is now patched by cheat developers and doesn't work anymore.  
I’m releasing it to **showcase my work** and promote the **new undetected detection methods** I’ve developed.

✅ **My current detections** include:
- ⚔️ Advanced Susano V3 detection (private)
- 🎯 Anti Aimbot & Anti Silent Aim (DMA resistant)
- 👁️ Overlay & External Cheat Detection
- 🧠 Beta Mode Lock (forces beta client – disables 99% of cheats)
