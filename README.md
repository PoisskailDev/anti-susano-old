## 🔍 What is this?

This script was designed to detect **Susano**, one of the most widespread FiveM cheats.  
It provided **instant detection**, based on low-level behavioral and memory patterns.

Even though this method is now outdated and patched, it serves as a demonstration of the past logic used.
